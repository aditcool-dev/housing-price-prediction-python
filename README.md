# 🏠 Housing Price Analysis and Prediction (Python)

This project analyzes housing sales data to identify key factors influencing house prices and builds a regression model to predict property values.  
The analysis demonstrates the end-to-end data science workflow including data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature evaluation, and predictive modeling using Python.
